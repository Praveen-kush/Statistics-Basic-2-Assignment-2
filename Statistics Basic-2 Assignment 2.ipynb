    "Mean: Outliers have a substantial impact on the mean. Since the mean is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of data points, extreme values (outliers) can pull the mean in their direction.\n",
    "Median: Less affected by outliers. The median is the \"middle\" value, so extreme values on either side have less influence unless they completely dominate the center of the data.\n",

    "Mean: The outlier (100) will inflate the mean compared to a dataset without it.\n",
    "Median: The median will likely remain close to 88, representing the \"middle\" score even with the outlier.\n",
    "Mode: The mode would likely still be between 75 and 90, depending on the frequency of those scores, unaffected by the single high score.\n",
    "Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: Outliers will increase the range, as the range is simply the difference between the highest and lowest values.\n",
    "Variance and Standard Deviation: Both are sensitive to outliers. Since they consider the squared deviations from the mean, extreme values will have a larger impact on the overall spread, inflating the variance and standard deviation.\n",
    "Overall:\n",
